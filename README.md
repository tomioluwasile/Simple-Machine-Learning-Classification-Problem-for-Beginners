# Can't taste 1,000 bottles of wine to discover the good ones? Try this model instead.
 You've probably seen this model somewhere else. Yes, but data can be interpreted in so many ways. From discovering the connection between wine with high alcohol content, to validating if pH level affects the quality of wine, this notebook is nowhere close to exploring all that is explorable. 
 
 However, if you simply want to know good ones vs bad ones based on their overall quality, this model does just that.
 
 Libraries and technologies used include:

Easy to train, easy to validate.
